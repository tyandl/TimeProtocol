TimeProtocol is a simple but complete implementation of RFC868. This should not be confused with Network Time Protocol (NTP) or Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) which are quite common and much more complicated. See http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc868 for specifications.

TimeProtocol implements both TCP and UDP communication and was writen in GO.
